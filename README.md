# BASE262144
Base-262144 is an experimental binary-to-text encoding that maps any data into 262,144 Unicode symbols (U+10000â€“U+4FFFF). Each character encodes 18 bits. Output looks like an alien script but is fully reversible. Includes a single-file web app, draft RFC spec, and ASCII-safe escape mode.
